## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Shape2D supports sweepOverlap for axis-aligned shape pairs

The engine SHALL provide a top-level function `fun sweepOverlap(a: Shape2D, aWorld: Transform, motion: Vec2, b: Shape2D, bWorld: Transform): SweepResult?` in `com.neoutils.engine.physics`. `SweepResult` MUST be a data class with `toi: Float` (in `[0f, 1f]`), `point: Vec2`, `normal: Vec2`, and `depenetration: Vec2` (defaulting to `Vec2.ZERO`). The function MUST return a non-null result with the smallest valid TOI when shape `a` swept by `motion` from `aWorld` would intersect shape `b` at `bWorld`, for any of the following pairs: (a) `CircleShape2D` vs `CircleShape2D`; (b) `CircleShape2D` vs `RectangleShape2D` (rect axis-aligned OR rotated); (c) `RectangleShape2D` vs `RectangleShape2D` (any combination of rotations on both transforms).

When the pair is `RectangleShape2D` vs `RectangleShape2D` and at least one transform has `rotation != 0f`, the function MUST use a temporal SAT (Separating Axis Theorem with motion-projection per axis) on the four candidate axes (two normals per OBB). When the pair is `CircleShape2D` vs `RectangleShape2D` (in either order) with the rect rotated, the function MUST transform the problem into the rect's local frame (inverse-rotate circle position and motion), reuse the axis-aligned circle-vs-rect math, and rotate the resulting `point` and `normal` back into the original frame.

For shapes returning `null`, the call MUST not panic — it MUST simply indicate "no swept contact found in `[0, 1]`". Callers (e.g. `CharacterBody2D.moveAndCollide`) interpret `null` as "advance the full motion".

#### Scenario: Swept circle-vs-circle returns the analytic TOI

- **GIVEN** circle A radius `5f` at `(0f, 0f)`, motion `(20f, 0f)`, circle B radius `5f` at `(12f, 0f)`
- **WHEN** code calls `sweepOverlap(a, aWorld, motion, b, bWorld)`
- **THEN** the result's `toi` is approximately `0.1f` (i.e. A travels `2f` of the `20f` motion before contact)
- **AND** the result's `normal` is approximately `Vec2(-1f, 0f)`

#### Scenario: Swept circle-vs-rect axis-aligned returns the analytic TOI

- **GIVEN** circle A radius `3f` at `(0f, 0f)`, motion `(10f, 0f)`, rect B `size=(4f, 4f)` at `(8f, 0f)`
- **WHEN** code calls `sweepOverlap(a, aWorld, motion, b, bWorld)` with both transforms at `rotation=0f`
- **THEN** the result's `toi` is approximately `0.5f`
- **AND** the result's `normal` is approximately `Vec2(-1f, 0f)`

#### Scenario: Swept rect-vs-rect axis-aligned returns the analytic TOI

- **GIVEN** rect A `size=(4f, 4f)` at `(0f, 0f)`, motion `(20f, 0f)`, rect B `size=(4f, 4f)` at `(10f, 0f)`
- **WHEN** code calls `sweepOverlap(a, aWorld, motion, b, bWorld)` with both transforms at `rotation=0f`
- **THEN** the result's `toi` is approximately `0.3f`
- **AND** the result's `normal` is approximately `Vec2(-1f, 0f)`

#### Scenario: Swept shape returns null when motion does not intersect

- **GIVEN** circle A radius `5f` at `(0f, 0f)`, motion `(10f, 0f)`, circle B radius `5f` at `(0f, 100f)`
- **WHEN** code calls `sweepOverlap(...)`
- **THEN** the function returns `null`

#### Scenario: Swept circle-vs-rotated-rect returns the analytic TOI in the rect's local frame

- **GIVEN** circle A radius `2f` at `(0f, 0f)`, motion `(20f, 0f)`, rect B `size=(4f, 4f)` at `(10f, 0f)` with `bWorld.rotation = π / 2` (B rotated 90° — local x becomes world y)
- **AND** in B's local frame the relevant face of B that A approaches is the local-bottom face at world `(10f, 0f)`
- **WHEN** code calls `sweepOverlap(...)`
- **THEN** the function returns a non-null `SweepResult`
- **AND** the `normal` corresponds to B's local-bottom-face normal rotated back to world (the value depends on the rotated geometry — the normal is the unit vector that the script can use to reflect)

#### Scenario: Swept rotated-rect-vs-rotated-rect returns the analytic TOI on aligned faces

- **GIVEN** rect A `size=(4f, 4f)` at `(0f, 0f)` with `aWorld.rotation = π / 4`, motion `(20f, 0f)`, rect B `size=(4f, 4f)` at `(10f, 0f)` with `bWorld.rotation = π / 4` (same rotation)
- **WHEN** code calls `sweepOverlap(...)`
- **THEN** the function returns a non-null `SweepResult`
- **AND** the `toi` is consistent with the geometric contact distance in the rotated frame

#### Scenario: Swept rotated-rect-vs-rotated-rect returns null when motion misses

- **GIVEN** rect A `size=(4f, 4f)` at `(0f, 0f)` with `aWorld.rotation = π / 4`, motion `(20f, 0f)`, rect B `size=(4f, 4f)` at `(0f, 100f)` with `bWorld.rotation = π / 4`
- **WHEN** code calls `sweepOverlap(...)`
- **THEN** the function returns `null`

#### Scenario: Starting-overlap on rotated pair returns toi=0 with depenetration

- **GIVEN** rect A `size=(10f, 10f)` at `(0f, 0f)` with `aWorld.rotation = π / 6` and rect B `size=(10f, 10f)` at `(5f, 0f)` with `bWorld.rotation = π / 6` (same rotation; deep overlap)
- **WHEN** code calls `sweepOverlap(a, aWorld, motion, b, bWorld)` with any `motion`
- **THEN** the function returns a non-null `SweepResult` with `toi == 0f`
- **AND** `depenetration` is a non-zero vector along the SAT axis of least overlap (the minimum-translation vector pointing from B toward A)

### Requirement: CharacterBody2D exposes moveAndCollide

The engine SHALL add a public method `fun moveAndCollide(motion: Vec2): KinematicCollision2D?` on `CharacterBody2D`. The method MUST perform a swept-shape test from the body's current world position along `motion` against every other live `PhysicsBody2D` (both `StaticBody2D` and `CharacterBody2D`) in the tree with `disabled == false` whose parent matches `this.parent`. `Area2D` instances MUST be ignored by `moveAndCollide` (areas are triggers, not blockers). If no collision is detected, the body's `transform.position` MUST be advanced by `motion` and the method MUST return `null`. If a collision is detected with smallest time-of-impact `toi` in `[0f, 1f]`, the body's `transform.position` MUST be advanced by `motion * toi + sweepResult.depenetration` (the body stops at the contact and, when starting-overlapping, is pushed out by the depenetration vector) and the method MUST return a `KinematicCollision2D` whose `remainder` equals `motion * (1f - toi)`.

The method MUST support arbitrary rotations of `this` and of target bodies, provided they share the same parent (so the sweep is performed in the common parent frame). Rotations local to `this` or to the target NO LONGER cause the swept test to fall through.

#### Scenario: moveAndCollide with no obstacles advances the full motion

- **GIVEN** a `CharacterBody2D` at world position `(0f, 0f)` with a `CollisionShape2D + CircleShape2D(radius=5f)` and an empty tree of other bodies
- **WHEN** the script calls `body.moveAndCollide(Vec2(100f, 0f))`
- **THEN** the call returns `null`
- **AND** `body.transform.position` equals `Vec2(100f, 0f)` after the call

#### Scenario: moveAndCollide stops at the contact with a static body

- **GIVEN** a `CharacterBody2D` A at world position `(0f, 0f)` with `CircleShape2D(radius=5f)`
- **AND** a `StaticBody2D` B at world position `(20f, 0f)` with `CircleShape2D(radius=5f)`
- **WHEN** the script calls `A.moveAndCollide(Vec2(20f, 0f))`
- **THEN** the call returns a non-null `KinematicCollision2D`
- **AND** `A.transform.position.x` is approximately `10f` (A's edge touches B's edge)
- **AND** the returned `normal` is approximately `Vec2(-1f, 0f)`
- **AND** the returned `collider` is B
- **AND** the returned `remainder` is approximately `Vec2(10f, 0f)` (half the requested motion)

#### Scenario: moveAndCollide ignores Area2D in the path

- **GIVEN** a `CharacterBody2D` A at `(0f, 0f)` with `CircleShape2D(radius=5f)`
- **AND** an `Area2D` T at `(10f, 0f)` with `CircleShape2D(radius=5f)`
- **WHEN** the script calls `A.moveAndCollide(Vec2(40f, 0f))`
- **THEN** the call returns `null`
- **AND** `A.transform.position` equals `Vec2(40f, 0f)`

#### Scenario: moveAndCollide returns TOI=0 with depenetration when bodies start overlapping

- **GIVEN** two `CharacterBody2D` A and B both with overlapping `CircleShape2D` (radius=5f each), with B center 4f away from A center
- **WHEN** the script calls `A.moveAndCollide(Vec2.ZERO)`
- **THEN** the call returns a non-null `KinematicCollision2D` with `toi == 0f` and `remainder == Vec2.ZERO`
- **AND** `A.transform.position` is advanced by the depenetration vector (separating A from B by the penetration depth along the contact normal)

#### Scenario: moveAndCollide on a rotated body bounces against a rotated wall

- **GIVEN** a `CharacterBody2D` A with `aWorld.rotation = π / 6` and `RectangleShape2D` size `(10f, 10f)`
- **AND** a `StaticBody2D` B in the path with `bWorld.rotation = π / 6` and `RectangleShape2D` size `(10f, 60f)`
- **WHEN** the script calls `A.moveAndCollide(motion)` with motion approaching B frontally in the shared rotated frame
- **THEN** the call returns a non-null `KinematicCollision2D` with a `toi` in `(0f, 1f)`
- **AND** the returned `normal` is the contact normal in the parent frame
- **AND** A's position advances by `motion * toi` (stops at contact, no tunneling)

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Behavioral integration test harness validates multi-frame sweep correctness

The engine test suite SHALL include a `BehavioralSweepTest` (or analogous) file in `engine/src/test/.../physics/` that exercises `CharacterBody2D.moveAndCollide` across **multiple frames** via a real `GameLoop` with a stub `Renderer` and stub `Input`. Each scenario MUST construct a scene, run N ticks at fixed `dt` (16.666 ms), record positions/velocities across frames, and assert **trajectory properties** rather than single-call outputs. The harness MUST cover at minimum:

- A bouncing body that should separate from a contact within K frames (no oscillation in place — guards against the tangent-leaving freeze pattern).
- A pair of bodies spawned overlapping that should reach mutual non-overlap within K frames (guards against the spawn-overlap freeze pattern).
- A body inside a rotated walled arena that, after N frames of bouncing, has covered measurable distance (guards against any rotated-sweep regression that re-introduces freezing).

The harness MUST NOT depend on `Skiko`, `Compose`, or any backend with display side-effects — it MUST run within `./gradlew :engine:test`.

#### Scenario: Bounce-then-separate harness asserts post-contact motion

- **GIVEN** a `CharacterBody2D` with initial velocity directed at a `StaticBody2D` wall
- **WHEN** the harness runs 30 frames via `GameLoop.tick(16_666_666L)`
- **THEN** at some frame `f` the body's position changes direction (bounce detected)
- **AND** for every frame `f+1` through `f+K`, the body's distance to the wall is strictly greater than at frame `f` (no re-collision within `K = 3` frames)

#### Scenario: Spawn-overlap harness asserts eventual separation

- **GIVEN** two `CharacterBody2D` spawned with overlapping shapes
- **WHEN** the harness runs `K = 5` frames
- **THEN** by the last frame the two bodies' shapes no longer overlap
- **AND** at no intermediate frame did the body's velocity oscillate (sign-flip more than once on the same axis without crossing a contact event)

#### Scenario: Rotated arena harness asserts measurable trajectory distance

- **GIVEN** a `CharacterBody2D` inside an arena bounded by four `StaticBody2D` walls at rotation `π / 4` (45°)
- **WHEN** the harness runs 60 frames with initial velocity at moderate speed
- **THEN** the cumulative Euclidean distance traveled by the body across all frames exceeds a threshold proportional to `|velocity| * dt * 60 * 0.5` (i.e. the body moves at least half the free-flight distance — confirming it is not frozen)

### Requirement: Demos module ships a rotated-sweep visualization scene

The `:games:demos` module SHALL include a scene that exercises the rotated swept path of `CharacterBody2D.moveAndCollide` visually in runtime (currently `TumblingSwarmDemo`, selectable via the `DemoSwitcherRoot` digit key). The scene MUST host multiple `CharacterBody2D` squares with non-zero `transform.rotation` (so every pair sweep routes through the rotated path, not the axis-aligned fast paths), arranged inside walls built from `StaticBody2D`. Each square MUST integrate an independent `angularVelocity` into its `transform.rotation` every physics tick, so the sweep snapshot of rotation varies across frames and the rotated path is exercised under motion + spin.

Contact response MUST apply a 2D rigid-body elastic impulse at the contact point that updates both linear and angular velocity from a single `j·n` application: `j = -(1+e)·(v_rel·n) / (1/mA + 1/mB + (rA × n)² / IA + (rB × n)² / IB)` with `e = 1`, `vAP = vA + ω × rA`, and `r = P − centro` for each body. The contact point `P` MUST be derived from the OBB geometry (not the OBB center) so that the angular impulse is non-zero on glancing hits: at minimum the **leading corner** of the rotated square in the `-n` direction (averaged over corners tied within a small epsilon, collapsing face-vs-face contacts to the face midpoint and zero spin). Wall hits MAY additionally apply a tangential Coulomb-friction impulse capped at `μ·|jn|` so sliding couples to spin (rolling against the arena). Pair hits MUST use a symmetric contact point (midpoint of the two bodies' leading offsets toward each other) so `rA` and `rB` are balanced and the angular impulse on the two bodies is symmetric rather than dominated by one side's lever arm.

#### Scenario: A rotated body's corner hit against a wall induces spin

- **GIVEN** a `CharacterBody2D` square at rotation `π / 6` moving frontally into a `StaticBody2D` wall (so contact is along an OBB corner, not a flat face)
- **WHEN** the demo's physics tick processes the collision
- **THEN** the body's `angularVelocity` after the collision differs from before by a non-zero amount (the lever arm of the contact corner relative to the body's center is non-zero, so the impulse produces angular change)

#### Scenario: A rotated body sliding along a wall picks up rolling

- **GIVEN** a `CharacterBody2D` square in tangential motion along a wall (velocity component parallel to the wall is non-zero at the contact)
- **WHEN** the demo's contact response applies the Coulomb-friction tangential impulse
- **THEN** the body's `angularVelocity` after the contact has changed in a sense consistent with rolling (sliding direction transfers to spin), bounded by the `μ·|jn|` cap

#### Scenario: Pair contact between two squares conserves angular momentum locally

- **GIVEN** two `CharacterBody2D` squares colliding in a glancing offset hit (the contact normal is not aligned with the line between centers)
- **WHEN** the demo's pair contact response applies the elastic impulse with the symmetric leading-midpoint contact point
- **THEN** the angular impulse magnitudes applied to the two bodies are of comparable order (one body's lever arm does not dominate the other by an unbounded factor), and the per-collision update preserves total linear + angular momentum and total kinetic energy within float precision
